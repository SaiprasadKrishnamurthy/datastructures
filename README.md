# Fundamental Datastructures and Algorithms in Scala #

A Simple implementation of DataStructures using scala.

I'm broadly focusing on simple data structures (their concepts) and implementing them in Scala.
This is not to implement a complete collections API as this is completely reinventing the wheel.
Rather the intent is to learn the foundational data structures, their strengths and weaknesses, their asymptotic analysis
and of course lean functional programming and scala.

## Simple Data Structures  ##
* Arrays
* ArrayLists
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues

## Intermediate Data Structures  ##
* Dictionaries (HashTables)
* Binary Trees
* Heaps

## Advanced Data structures ##
 * B-Trees
 * Graphs

## A Simple Time complexity table ##
DATA STRUCTURE|SEARCH | INSERT | DELETE
--------------|-------|--------|--------
Arrays        | O(n)  | O(n)   | O(n) 
ArrayLists    | O(n)  | O(n)   | O(n) 
LinkedLists   | O(n)  | O(1)   | O(1)
